This repository contains all the work I completed in 'CS:421-Advanced Web Application Development' course at 
The University of Alabama at Birmingham. In this course we covered the basics of full stack development getting
experience with Github, Front-End and Back-End development, database creation and management, frameworks (Flask & Apache2),
virtual machines and working with API's. My final project for this course is also posted on my profile under "WebDevFinal"
